  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"
  # config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then

  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    vb.gui = true
	vb.name = "Ubuntu20.04_SUMO_DevEnv"

	# customizations, below, to suit the needs/limits of your local machine.

    # Set the graphicscontroller and amount of Video RAM
	vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--graphicscontroller", "vboxvga"]
	vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--vram", "256"]
    # Enabling the I/O APIC is required for 64-bit guest operating systems, especially Windows Vista;
    # it is also required if you want to use more than one virtual CPU in a VM.

	vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--hwvirtex", "on"]
    # Enable, if Guest Additions are installed, whether hardware 3D acceleration should be available

	vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--clipboard', 'bidirectional']
	# See Chapter 8. VBoxManage | VirtualBox Manual located @ virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html
